To construct the sage file from the source of the TeX file, the following steps were performed:

- Copy the terms you want to sum up (add + to each new block if needed).
- Remove all terms with y, g, or gg.
- Additionally for A and B2c: 
    Remove all terms involving \sum (by hand). 
    We consider only the case where i is even, i.e. replace (-1)^i by + and (-1)^{i+1} by -.

- Do the following search-replaces:
    Remove \boldsymbol.
    Remove \uwave.
    Replace \shift^{-1} with shiftinverse.
    Remove all \.
    Remove all &.
    Remove all {.
    Remove all }.
    Remove all ^.
    Remove all (.
    Remove all ).
    Remove all spaces.
- Put all terms into var('underbracehatomegahatomegavarphi_1'); etc.
- Put a ; after the last term.
- Join the lines for the calculation.
- Remove all spaces.
