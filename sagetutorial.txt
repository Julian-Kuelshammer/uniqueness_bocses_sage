To construct the sage file from the source of the TeX file, the following steps were performed:

- Copy the terms you want to sum up (add + to each new block if needed)
- Remove all terms with y, g, or gg (by hand)
- Additionally for A and B2c: 
- Remove all terms involving \sum (by hand), 
- We consider only the case where i is even, i.e. replace (-1)^i by + and (-1)^{i+1} by -

- Do the following search-replaces:
    Remove \boldsymbol
    Remove \uwave
    Replace \shift^{-1} with shiftinverse
    Remove all \
    Remove all &
    Remove all {
    Remove all }
    Remove all ^
    Remove all (
    Remove all )
    Remove all spaces
- Put all terms into var('underbracehatomegahatomegavarphi_1'); etc.
- Put a ; after the last term.
- Join the lines for the calculation.
- Remove all spaces.
